# First-Audit-Project

Hello!

I have completed the audit scope and goals, as well as a risk assessment. At a high level, the main goals and risks are as follows:

Goals:

Improve Botium Toysâ€™ current security posture by aligning to industry best practices (e.g., adhere to the NIST CSF, implement concept of least permissions)

Provide mitigation recommendations (i.e., controls, policies, documentation), based on current risks

Identify compliance regulations Botium Toys must adhere to, primarily based on where we conduct business and how we accept payments

To review the full report, read the Botium Toys: Audit scope and goals document

Risks:

Inadequate management of assets

Proper controls are not in place

May not be compliant with U.S. and international regulations and guidelines

Current risk score is 8/10 (high), due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance regulations and standards

To review the complete list of assets and risks, read the Botium Toys: Risk assessment document 

Thank you,
Botium Toys IT Manager

=====================================
Questions To Think about:

1. What are the biggest risks to the organization?

2. Which controls are most essential to implement immediately versus in the future?

3. Which compliance regulations does Botium Toys need to adhere to, to ensure the company keeps customer and vendor data safe, avoids fines, etc.?
